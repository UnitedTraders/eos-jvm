### [eos-chain-actions](https://github.com/memtrip/eos-jvm/tree/master/eos-chain-actions)
An EOS SDK for pushing actions to the EOS system contracts. This high level abstraction composes the other eos-jvm modules to seamlessly handle transaction signing, byte writing and api requests.

### [eos-core](https://github.com/memtrip/eos-jvm/tree/master/eos-core)
An EOS client library containing the core building blocks required to interact with the EOS network.

### [eos-http-rpc](https://github.com/memtrip/eos-jvm/tree/master/eos-http-rpc)
An EOS client library that uses an OkHttpClient to make requests to the nodeos RPC HTTP API.

### [eos-abi-writer](https://github.com/memtrip/eos-jvm/tree/master/eos-abi-writer)
A local replacement of `abi_json_to_bin`, annotation processing is used to generate reliable Abi byte writing boilerplate code.
